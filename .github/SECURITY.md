## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability in public forums, chat, or social media

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@example.com
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 48 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure after the fix is available

### Security Measures

#### Code Security
- All dependencies are regularly updated
- Automated security scanning with CodeQL
- Static analysis with Bandit and Semgrep
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with Safety

#### Data Security
- No sensitive data is stored in the repository
- Environment variables are used for configuration
- Secrets are never committed to version control
- Generated presentations are not stored permanently

#### Infrastructure Security
- Branch protection on main branch
- Required PR reviews
- Automated CI/CD security checks
- Signed commits recommended

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Initial report made privately
2. **Coordinated Fix**: We work together on a fix
3. **Responsible Timeline**: Reasonable time to fix before disclosure
4. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated public announcement after fix
5. **Credit**: Security researchers are credited (if desired)

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

#### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

#### Dependency Security
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories for dependencies
- Use virtual environments for Python development
- Audit npm packages before installation

#### Development Security
- Use branch protection rules
- Require PR reviews for sensitive changes
- Enable two-factor authentication on GitHub
- Use signed commits when possible

### Security-Related Dependencies

#### Python Security Tools
- `safety` - Checks for known security vulnerabilities
- `bandit` - Security linter for Python code
- `pip-audit` - Audits Python packages for known vulnerabilities

#### Node.js Security Tools
- `npm audit` - Checks for known vulnerabilities in npm packages
- Built-in security scanning in GitHub Actions

### Vulnerability Response Process

1. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact
2. **Investigation**: Reproduce and understand the issue
3. **Fix Development**: Create and test a fix
4. **Security Review**: Review fix for completeness
5. **Testing**: Verify fix doesn't break functionality
6. **Release**: Deploy fix in next release
7. **Disclosure**: Coordinate public disclosure
8. **Documentation**: Update security documentation

### Security Contacts
