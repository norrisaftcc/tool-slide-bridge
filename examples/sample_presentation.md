## Technical Architecture

```python
# Example: Simple AI Pipeline
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('business_data.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Train model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Deploy to production
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")
```
