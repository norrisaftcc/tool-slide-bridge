# Machine Learning Fundamentals

A comprehensive introduction to ML concepts and applications.

---

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Classification (categorical output)
- Regression (continuous output)
- Examples: Spam detection, price prediction

### 2. Unsupervised Learning  
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Agent-based learning
- Reward optimization
- Examples: Game AI, robotics

# Example: Linear Regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Training data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Create and train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict([[6], [7]])
print(predictions)  # Output: [12, 14]
```
